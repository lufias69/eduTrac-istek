<p>This screen allows you to set two types of prerequisites: Course and Rule.</p>
<p>When making changes, you must click "Load Rule" in order to bring the changes to the screen and then click "Update".</p>
<p><strong>Course Prerequisites:</strong> Use this option to set what courses a student must complete and pass before registering for this course. Please note that all courses in the field will be used for requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> At the bottom of the screen, you can set prerequisite rules in conjunction with or without setting the courses prerequisite. With the rule, you can check to make sure a student has the right academic level, program, program status, number of completed credits, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Print Text:</strong> Use this field to add text that should be presented to the staff member when he or she tries to register a student who does not meet the prerequisite requirement(s). If the staff member has the `override_rule` permission, then the prerequisites will be bypassed.</p>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong> In order to test your rule, click the <span class="btn btn-inverse"><i class="fa fa-caret-square-o-right"></i></span> icon to the right of the help icon. The icon will not appear until after you've saved your rule. You should always check a few students out first to make sure your rule is working.</p>
<p><strong>Clear:</strong> Sometimes you may make a mistake on a rule and when you click the "Load" button, you get an error and nothing loads. When this happens, you may need to click the "Clear" button to set the <em>rule</em> field to <em>null</em> and start over.</p>
